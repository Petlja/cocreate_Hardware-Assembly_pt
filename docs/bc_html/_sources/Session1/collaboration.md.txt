# Collaboration

## How to collaborate effectively

Developing collaboration skills within your team is essential for this activity. While completing each task, please follow these rules to ensure an **inclusive, respectful, and co-responsible** collaboration process. 

Your group will be **assessed on how effectively** (1 – Not followed at all; 2 – Mostly not followed; 3 – Mostly followed; 4 – Fully followed) it demonstrates each of these aspects of teamwork.

**Collaboration rules:**
1. We are all equal and we respect one another.
2. We foster a good atmosphere even when we think differently.
3. We are all responsible for group work and results.
4. We help everyone contribute to group work.
5. We strive to involve everyone in decision-making.
6. We consider many ideas before selecting the best one.
7. We expound on ideas, weigh arguments, and devise solutions.
8. We use time wisely to work on the task.
9. We monitor progress and plan the next step.
```

**Exercise.** Read the five problematic situations that occurred in student teams while completing a task similar to yours.

1) At the start of the activity, one student admits: “I’ve never opened a computer before, so I don’t think I’ll be much help.” The rest of the group accepts this without discussion and allows the student to sit aside. Throughout the session, the student only passes tools when asked and does not participate in documentation or decision-making. By the end, the student feels disconnected and excluded, and has not developed the skills intended by the activity. 

2) While reassembling the computer, one student notices that a screw is missing. Another student blames them loudly, causing tension in the group. The team atmosphere becomes negative, and they struggle to continue working together.

3) Two students disagree on the correct order for removing components. Instead of discussing calmly, they start arguing, and the group loses time. The tutorial notes become confusing because of the lack of clear decisions.

4) While preparing the tutorial, two students disagree about how detailed the step descriptions should be. One insists on very short notes with photos, while the other wants long explanations. The group cannot move forward because of the disagreement. 

5) The group agreed that one student would take photos during disassembly. At the end of the task, they realize the photos are blurry and incomplete, and the tutorial cannot be finished properly. Other group members are upset.

In the groups you formed, **discuss the situation and agree on a solution**. While doing so, reflect on the following questions:
1. What did the team members do wrong, and which collaboration rules were violated in this situation?
1. Which rules did your group apply to solve the problem?
1. What lessons can you take from this to improve your teamwork in the future?
