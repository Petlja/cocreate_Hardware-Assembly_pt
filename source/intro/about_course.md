# About the Course

## Objectives

- Learn techniques and procedures for assembling and disassembling computer equipment.
- Learn how to work with hand tools, protective gear, and technology, using laptops and the platform correctly.
- Develop collaboration, communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and time management skills.

## Prerequisites

Students participating in this activity should already be familiar with the components used in assembling computer systems, as well as their key specifications, including:

- Power Supply: Power rating (W), Voltage (V), Molex, SATA and PCIe (for GPUs) **connectors, Form factors** (ATX, SFX, etc.)
- Motherboard: CPU socket type (e.g., LGA, AM), **RAM slots** (number and type), Expansion slots (PCI, PCIe, M.2), USB ports (2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, USB-C), Data and power **connectors** (SATA, Molex, M.2, NVMe) **Chipset and overall compatibility**.
- RAM: Capacity and technology (e.g., DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4), Transfer rate and frequency, Timings, ECC support, **Chip layout**
- Hard Drive (HDD): Rotation speed (RPM), Data transfer rate, Data and power connections, **Connectors** (SATA, Molex).
- Solid State Drive (SSD): **Connectors** (SATA, M.2 SATA, NVMe PCIe), Read/write speed (MB/s or GB/s).
- Processor (CPU): Number of cores and threads, Base and turbo frequency (GHz), Cache (L1, L2, L3), Power consumption (TDP), **Compatibility with motherboard/socket**.
- Cooling Systems: Fans (size, RPM, airflow in CFM), CPU cooler (air or liquid cooling), **Thermal paste** (thermal conductivity W/mK)
- Case / Chassis: **Form factor** (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX), Cable management features, Space for fans, Drive bays for HDD/SSD.

# Course Description

In this course, learners will **safely and collaboratively disassemble and reassemble a computer system**, identify and record its components, and produce clear, accurate technical documentation of the entire process. The activity will be carried out across four sessions:

## Sessions

### Session 1 - Collaboration and Safety Rules

We will form work groups, review **collaboration tips** to guide your teamwork in completing the activity, and go over **safety protocols** for handling hardware components.

### Session 2 - Developing a Disassembly Tutorial

Each group will disassemble a computer, documenting each step with written notes and photographs to create a **disassembly tutorial**.

### Session 3 - Creating a Hardware Inventory

With the computer disassembled, each group will proceed to identify and document the technical specifications of the components to create a **hardware inventory**. 

### Session 4 - Developing an Assembly Tutorial

Each group will develop an **assembly tutorial** by reassembling the computer, and documenting and taking pictures of the process.
